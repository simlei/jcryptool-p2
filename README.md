## Welcome to the [JCrypTool](https://github.com/jcryptool/core) RCP P2 Update Site

This is a makeshift Eclipse Update Site for development purposes and will most probably be moved to the JCrypTool organization's repository in the process of releasing the Milestone 1.0.

This site can be used with Maven Tycho and with Scala's sbt + [osgi-manager](https://github.com/digimead/sbt-osgi-manager) to build your project with JCrypTool codebase and eclipse target platform.

The update site's url you can point your resolver to is this: [https://simlei.github.io/jcryptool-p2/](https://simlei.github.io/jcryptool-p2/)
