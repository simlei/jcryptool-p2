## Welcome to the [JCrypTool](https://github.com/jcryptool/core) RCP P2 Update Site

This is only a temporary address used for development and will be moved soon to the JCrypTool organization's repository.

This site can be used with Maven Tycho and with Scala's sbt + [osgi-manager](https://github.com/digimead/sbt-osgi-manager) to build your project with JCrypTool codebase and eclipse target platform.

The update site's url you can point your resolver to is this: [https://simlei.github.io/jcryptool-p2/](https://simlei.github.io/jcryptool-p2/)
